//This discussion is making me really think about the ethics that are going to go into my game. 
My game is about Mythical beings and a young man killing them to get the components to save his own life. But Now I want to go through
the game and question why his life is more important than that of thes beings that have lasted for what is the main protagonists "forever". 
I want the end of the game to be him politely asking for the last component, and deciding along the way if he is worthy or not, and 
if he made enough selfish choices, then he has to fight the last boss, but if he is not selfish the being is benevolent.
